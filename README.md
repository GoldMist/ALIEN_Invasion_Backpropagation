A generalised backpropagation algorithm for avoiding local minima and improving runtime efficiency.  Algorithm uses random restarts with adaptable selection and deletion heuristics.  A 3-coloring of a weighted subgraph to dynamically transform sub-distribution probabilities was proposed to generate new sets of weights and bias parameters.
